## Background

This project is done purely with respect for Spotify and especially its development team.

Icons/SVGs etc I use in the video are owned by Spotify and I will not be deploying this application anywhere, neither should you.

Use this repository to follow along with me as I educate myself on best React.js practices and improve my UI development skills.

Hope you enjoy and learn something!

Sidenote: If you spot anything that I can improve, please feel free to contribute and I will feature in the YT series.

### `npm install && npm start`

To run the application
